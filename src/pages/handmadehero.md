Ramble: 
- I kept debating on, if i should start from day1, infact i know a little bit of C, but not well, just a little,  
I learnt from the kk.king book and did some leetcode problems. And in fact i went over handmade hero first couple   
of videos by skimming through them. My main feeling is that it was outdated, I for one, love to quickly get my  
hands dirty, by setting up a git repo, starting a readme file, and start the main.c file, but immediately it comes to  
a halt when i saw, most of the first few days videos are on Windows platform.  

- What i come to learn is that, this giant (Casey) has been working on this project since 2014, which shows the incredible  
educational effort that went into it. And for everyone(including me initially) who scuffs at the length of the content or   
the platform that he is working on, are poor learners, they don't meant to go deep in the subject. And it makes perfect sense,  
this project is not for the average web dev, it is for the hardcore programmers, and everything that i think of as barrier,  
is myself being the mediocore developer, which i have to kill. So here we fucking go, starting with Day-01, no skipping anything.  

Infact i will take this oppurtunity to create summaries, of every single video, and make a short comprehensive guide through these  
day by articles, on how to navigate this course. I feel like this course is much much more than a university can ever offer, in  
terms of value and quality.  
- This [article](https://medium.com/@ToddCullum/developers-what-handmade-hero-is-and-why-you-should-watch-it-8e88e9c2836e) helped me solidify my above conclusion
and this [video with time-stamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xJeEcq16hY&t=710s) said that the first 30 videos are magnitudes greater in  
teaching than a university can ever teach about CS.


My Journey into `Handmade Hero`  
Jan-24-2025 (my day 01)
[Intro to C on Windows - Day 1](https://guide.handmadehero.org/intro-to-c/day1/)
- Basics of CPU, Processors, cores
- setup visual studio, set up project as windows application project not console project  

Jan-25-2025 (my day 02)
[Intro to C on Windows - Day 2](https://guide.handmadehero.org/intro-to-c/day2/)
- how to use 'disassembly' in visual studio
- How to debug
- windows expects \r\n, the visual compiler converts \n to \r\n automatically,  
  but when you want to write/modify a file and want to insert \n, make sure to write  
  file in binary mode, so that the visual compiler doesn't convert \n to \r\n  
- basics of assembly and registers. But having gone through this [x86 Assembly with NASM playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2EF13wm-hWCoj6tUBGUmrkJmH1972dBB)  
  atleast the  the first 5 videos has helped a lot of understanding x86 and assembly.
